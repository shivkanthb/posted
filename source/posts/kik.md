<h2 class="heading" data-content="kik">Introducing: Full screen mode and stickers for video chat!</h2>
<p class="post-meta">July 21, 2017</p>

Back in December of 2016, we released the highly anticipated video chat feature. It was such a success that we decided to Kik things up a notch and introduce full screen video chat. Now you can see your friendsâ€™ faces in full-screen HD without having to squint! ðŸ˜…

Thatâ€™s not all! This new feature also comes with video chat stickers to let you customize your experience. Maybe youâ€™re shy, have a pimple (itâ€™s okay, weâ€™ve been there) or just want to see what youâ€™d look like with a moustache and glasses. Add the video chat stickers and let the fun begin!!

Hereâ€™s a look at some of the stickers we have:

July is National Ice Cream Month! To celebrate, weâ€™ve created two sweet treats: a (questionableðŸ’©) chocolate swirl cone and a color-changing rainbow cone.
